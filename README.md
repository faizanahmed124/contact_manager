# contact_manager
I developed a Contact Manager application in Python to store, manage, and organize contact information. This project is a console-based application that allows users to:  Add new contacts  View all contacts  Search for contacts by name or phone number  Update existing contacts  Delete contacts  Save contacts to a file (JSON/CSV)
